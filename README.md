App to make balanced teams.

This is a project that was born at the university. We play soccer several times a week and sometimes it takes some time to form the teams.
And sometimes the teams are unbalanced. So for fun, we decided to make an app that makes balanced teams.

How to use:
1) Add members, assign each member a name and a weight. The weight is a scale from 0 to 10 that represents the ability of the member. Just
assign a fair value to each member and the teams should be well balanced.
2) Make teams.
3) Play!
